in the addition program what is #
int main( void )
why is void written in between the brackets?
scanf( "%d", &integer1 ); 
why is there "&" before integer1?

answers to day2 question

1) variable 
   they are simply names used to refer locations in a memory.
2) "int" is the type of variable used in the above program.
3) "int", "float" etc are the common type of variables.

Addition program
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int n1;
    int n2;
    int sum;

    printf("Enter the first number: \n");
    scanf("%d",&n1);
    printf("Enter the second number: \n");
    scanf("%d",&n2);
    sum = n1 + n2;
    printf("The sum of the 2 numbers are %d",sum);
    return 0;

}
